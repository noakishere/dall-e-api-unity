# OpenAI Dall-E integration in Unity

This package is a demo of how Dall-E API could be used in Unity

Make sure to include your API key in `OpenAICall.cs`

## Why would this be useful?

This prompt based image generation could be useful for texture generation of any sort. In this demo, we use the generated 2D images and apply it to a 2D sprite.

However, this textures could be used for 3D models, etc.

**Please note**: This Demo uses Dall-E 3. You could change the model to Dall-E 2.
